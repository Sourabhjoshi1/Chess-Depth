# 🤝 Contributing to ChessDepth Academy Website

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ChessDepth Academy website! We appreciate your help in making our platform the best resource for aspiring chess players.

## 🌟 How Can I Contribute?

We welcome contributions of all kinds, including:

1.  **Bug Reports:** Report unexpected behavior, broken links, or visual glitches.
2.  **Feature Suggestions:** Propose new content sections, layout improvements, or functional tools (like new resources).
3.  **Code Fixes:** Submit pull requests (PRs) to fix existing bugs or implement minor improvements.
4.  **Content Refinement:** Help improve grammar, clarity, or SEO metadata.

## 📝 Contribution Standards

To maintain code quality and consistency across the project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

### General Rules

* **Technology Stack:** The core technology stack is **HTML5, Tailwind CSS (v2.x), and Vanilla JavaScript.** Please avoid introducing new frameworks or large libraries unless absolutely necessary and first approved by a core maintainer.
* **File Structure:** All contributions must respect the existing file structure:
    * Core pages (`.html`) remain in the root directory.
    * Custom CSS styles should be placed within the `<style>` tags of the respective HTML file (or in `style.css` if we centralize it later).
    * Images should be linked from the `images/` or `favicon/` folder.
* **Aesthetics:** Maintain the current visual style, color palette (Indigo/Purple/Orange), and clean, professional aesthetic.
* **Responsiveness:** All changes must be fully functional and visually appealing on desktop, tablet, and mobile phone screen sizes.

### Code Standards

* **HTML:** Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.). Do not use raw Markdown syntax (like `**bold**`)—use `<strong>` for bolding.
* **CSS:** Favor **Tailwind CSS utility classes** over writing custom CSS whenever possible. Custom styles should be minimal and clearly documented.
* **JavaScript:** Use standard modern (ES6+) JavaScript. Ensure code is commented, clear, and does not introduce global variables unnecessarily.

## ⚙️ Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Fork the main repository to your personal GitHub account.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your contribution. Use descriptive names (e.g., `bugfix/fix-mobile-nav` or `feature/add-new-resource`).
3.  **Make Changes:** Implement your bug fix or feature within your new branch.
4.  **Test:** Test your changes locally on different screen sizes and browsers.
5.  **Commit:** Write clear, concise, and atomic commit messages (e.g., "FEAT: Added Lichess analysis link to resources page").
6.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Submit a Pull Request from your branch back to the `main` branch of the original repository.

### Pull Request Review

All Pull Requests will be reviewed by **AFM Sourabh Joshi** or designated maintainers. We aim to review PRs promptly and provide constructive feedback.
